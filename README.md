# Flight Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the SQL scripts and documentation necessary to perform a comprehensive flight data analysis. The data is processed to find patterns related to delays and operations.

## Project Structure

- `flights_query.sql` - SQL script to query and aggregate flight data.
- `Data Export Instructions.md` - Instructions on how to export query results to CSV for analysis in Power BI.

## Setup Instructions

### Database Setup
1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system.
2. Create or select a database that contains the required `flights` and `planes` tables.
3. Run the SQL script `flights_query.sql` to aggregate the data needed for analysis.

### Data Export
Follow the instructions in `Data Export Instructions.md` to export the required data from MySQL to a CSV file, which will be used in Power BI.

### Analysis in Power BI
1. Import the exported CSV file into Power BI.
2. Create visualizations as described in the project outline to analyze the data.
3. Publish the Power BI report and provide a link in this document if required.

## Usage
- Run the SQL queries in MySQL Workbench or any SQL interface configured to access your database.
- Export the data and analyze it in Power BI according to the guidelines provided in this repository.
